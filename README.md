# TourCompany_OLTPDatabaseDesign
 It is a graduation project that I did during the SQL Bootcamp training process organized by <a href='https://www.techcareer.net/'>Techcareer.net </a>.
Within the scope of the project, the OLTP Database Design of the TourCompany company, which organizes daily trips in Istanbul, has been made.
